These type definitions enable full TypeScript type checking for Foundry API versions *12* and *13*.
This guide will walk you through setting up your Foundry project to use TypeScript with the `foundry-vtt-types` type definitions.
Whether you are writing a system, a module, or simply a macro this guide can be useful to you if you want to use TypeScript during development.

If you are unfamiliar with TypeScript, start here:

.*What is TypeScript? Why should I use it?*
[%collapsible]
====
TypeScript is a developer-facing language based on JavaScript. Think of it like a "wrapper" around JavaScript that adds additional syntax and features to help you write better code, including static typing, enhanced tooling, and better support for modern programming practices.

Coding in TypeScript will help you spot errors earlier; make your code more robust, easier to navigate, and less vulnerable to error; and help make sure even complex refactors don't break everything.

A full introduction to TypeScript is beyond the scope of this document.
If you are new to coding with TypeScript, the *link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/[official documentation]* includes several tutorials for programmers of all skill levels.

= Setting Up Your Foundry TypeScript Project

This process can be broadly divided into four steps:

[upperalpha]
. <<project-setup,Configuring Your Project to Use TypeScript>>
. <<typescript-config,Configuring TypeScript to Use `foundry-vtt-types`>>
. <<foundry-config,Configuring `foundry-vtt-types` to Work with Your Specific Project>>
. <<vite-config,Configuring Vite to Compile Your Project>>

The remainder of this guide will walk you through each of these steps.

[NOTE]
====
This is a *highly opinionated* guide. It is not intended to provide you with a complete understanding of the many different ways you could set up your TypeScript project, but rather to offer a quick, clear, and convenient recipe that should be more than enough for the majority of use cases.
====
[[project-setup]]
== A. Configuring Your Project to Use TypeScript

=== Initializing Your Project with `npm`

Ensure your project is properly set up for Node.js and `npm` (i.e. it has a `package.json` file).
You can initialize a new `npm` project by running the following terminal command from the root directory of your project:

[source,console]
----
npm init
----

This command will guide you through creating a `package.json` file. You can accept the default values or customize them as needed for your project.

=== Installing TypeScript

TypeScript is a language that compiles into JavaScript. This means before Foundry VTT can execute it must be compiled into plain JavaScript.

To get started, you'll need to install the TypeScript compiler.
The easiest way to do this is via link:https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager[Node.js] and its package manager, `npm`. If you don't already have Node.js installed, download and install it from the provided link. Then, open your terminal and run the following command:

[source,console]
----
npm add --include=dev typescript
----

To confirm the installation, you can check the compiler version by running:

[source,console]
----
npx tsc --version
----

This should display the version number of TypeScript, indicating it has been installed in your project successfully.

=== Organizing Your Files and Folders

Once your npm project is set up, organize your project with the following folder structure. Just create the folders at this point; this guide includes files that will be used later for reference that you don't need to worry about them yet:

[listing]
----
my-typescript-project
├── dist                    <1>
├── static                  <2>
│   ├── assets
│   │   ├── images
│   │   └── fonts
│   ├── lang
│   │   └── en.json
│   ├── packs
│   ├── templates
│   └── system.json          // (or module.json)
├── src                     <3>
│   ├── module
│   │   └── my-typescript-project.ts
│   └── styles
│       └── my-typescript-project.scss
├── package.json
├── README.md
├── tsconfig.json
└── vite.config.ts
----
<1> After Vite compiles and builds your project, the `dist` folder will contain your final system or module in its entirety _(i.e. what you'll actually distribute to users)_.
<2> The `static` folder contains project files that don't require any compiling or processing before they are used, such as images, fonts, localization files, Handlebars templates, etc. These files will be copied to the `dist` folder as-is during the build process. _(A few examples have been included, which may or may not be relevant to your project.)_
<3> Conversely, the `src` folder contains files that need processing before they can be used, such as TypeScript files that must be compiled to JavaScript and SCSS files that must be compiled to CSS.

[[typescript-config]]
== B. Configuring TypeScript to Use `foundry-vtt-types`

=== Your `tsconfig.json` File

TypeScript settings can be defined in a `tsconfig.json` file located in the root folder of your project (i.e. adjacent to your project's `package.json` file). This file allows you to customize TypeScript's behavior, specify which files to compile and which types to include, and set up various other compiler options.

Create a blank `tsconfig.json` file in your project's root directory, and copy the following into it:

[source,json]
----
{
  "$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "allowImportingTsExtensions": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": false,
    "module": "Node16",
    "noEmit": true,
    "target": "ES2023",
    "outDir": "dist",
    "types": ["fvtt-types"],
    "verbatimModuleSyntax": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "strict": true,
    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,
    "noUncheckedSideEffectImports": true,
    "useUnknownInCatchVariables": true,
    "noImplicitOverride": true
  }
}
----
[NOTE]
.Adding Additional Type Libraries
====
The `"types"` array is where you'll add any type libraries you need for your project, in addition to `fvtt-types` (which must be here for this library to function). For example, if you use jQuery in your project, you'll want to add `"jquery"` to this array.
====

If you'd like to dig a bit deeper into what each of these settings do, read on:

.*`tsconfig.json` Settings Summary*
[%collapsible]
====
[horizontal]
link:https://json.schemastore.org/tsconfig.json[$schema]:: Points to the official JSON Schema definition for TypeScript configuration files. This enables better editor support, including autocompletion and validation of your `tsconfig.json` settings.
+
Setting this to *"https://json.schemastore.org/tsconfig.json"* helps catch configuration errors and provides inline documentation.

link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#allowImportingTsExtensions[allowImportingTsExtensions]:: Controls whether you can use TypeScript-specific extensions (like `.ts`) in import statements. By default, TypeScript expects you to either omit the extension or use `.js` extensions (e.g., `import "./myFile"` or `import "./myFile.js"`), even when importing from `.ts` files.
+
Setting this to *true* enables importing with `.ts` extensions. _(This works together with Vite's build process - Vite knows how to handle these TypeScript imports and will ensure they work correctly in the final JavaScript bundle.)_

link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#esModuleInterop[esModuleInterop]:: Smooths out differences between how different module systems handle imports and exports. By default, TypeScript applies stricter rules that can cause compatibility issues.
+
Setting this to *true* helps prevent problems when importing libraries. _(While Foundry uses ES Modules, some older libraries you might need could use different formats. This setting helps them work together seamlessly.)_

link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#allowSyntheticDefaultImports[allowSyntheticDefaultImports]:: Controls whether you can use simplified import syntax for modules that don't explicitly define default exports, which includes many Foundry API features.
+
Setting this to *false* ensures your imports match Foundry's module structure exactly, preventing subtle runtime errors.

link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#module[module]:: Determines how TypeScript generates JavaScript module code from your source files. By default, TypeScript uses CommonJS style modules.
+
Setting this to *"Node16"* is necessary for certain internal imports in `foundry-vtt-types` to work. Future updates may change this requirement.

link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#noEmit[noEmit]:: Controls whether TypeScript should prevent ("no emit") the generation of JavaScript files during compilation.
+
Setting this to *true* prevents the TypeScript compiler from creating actual JavaScript files when it is run. _(This may seem counterproductive, but as you'll soon see, we'll be using Vite to create the final JavaScript for your project, rather than the TypeScript compiler directly.)_

link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#target[target]:: Specifies which JavaScript version your TypeScript code should be converted to. By default, TypeScript targets older versions of JavaScript for maximum compatibility.
+
Since Foundy itself uses very modern features, setting this to *"ES2023"* aligns with Foundry.

link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#outDir[outDir]:: Specifies where compiled JavaScript files should be placed relative to your source TypeScript files.
+
Setting this to *"dist"* ensures that your compiled JavaScript is placed in the `dist` folder, which aligns with the file structure described above.

link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#types[types]:: Lists any additional type definition packages that should be included globally in your project. By default, TypeScript automatically includes all `@types` packages it can find in `node_modules`.
+
Defining values in this array prevents automatic type inclusion except for the type libraries specified here.

link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#verbatimModuleSyntax[verbatimModuleSyntax]:: Controls how TypeScript preserves your module import and export statements. This setting prevents TypeScript from rewriting your import/export syntax.
+
Setting this to *true* ensures your imports work exactly as written. _(This is particularly important when working with Foundry's module system, as unexpected transformations of import statements can cause hard-to-debug runtime errors.)_

link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#forceConsistentCasingInFileNames[forceConsistentCasingInFileNames]:: Ensures that casing in imported files must exactly match the actual filename. For example, `import "./MyFile"` won't work if the file is actually named `myfile.ts`.
+
Setting this to *true* prevents bugs that could occur when your project runs on case-sensitive systems. _(This is especially important if anyone contributing to your project develops on Windows where imports_ are _case insensitive, because your users might be running Foundry on Linux, where `MyFile.ts` and `myfile.ts` are treated as different files.)_

link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#resolveJsonModule[resolveJsonModule]:: Allows importing JSON files directly for automatic types.
+
Setting this to *true* enables proper typing for your project's JSON files. _(This is particularly useful for working with your module.json manifest file and any data templates you create, ensuring type safety when accessing their contents.)_

link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#strict[strict]:: Enables TypeScript's complete set of strict type checking options. By default, these strict checks are disabled.
+
Setting this to *true* enables all of the following:
+
* link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#noImplicitAny[`noImplicitAny`]: Requires you to explicitly declare your types. By default, TypeScript will infer the `any` type for any variable that doesn't have an explicit type declaration. This is risky because the `any` type bypasses all type checking, potentially leading to runtime errors. Explicit type declarations enhance code safety and maintainability.
* link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#strictNullChecks[`strictNullChecks`]: Forces you to handle cases where values might be `null` _(common when working with optional document fields)_
* link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#strictFunctionTypes[`strictFunctionTypes`]: Makes sure your function parameters match exactly _(important when implementing Foundry's interfaces)_
* link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#strictBindCallApply[`strictBindCallApply`]: Ensures correct typing when using JavaScript's function methods _(especially relevant when working with event handlers)_
* link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#strictPropertyInitialization[`strictPropertyInitialization`]: Makes sure you properly initialize class properties _(helpful when extending Foundry's document classes)_
* link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#noImplicitThis[`noImplicitThis`]: Prevents confusion about what `this` refers to _(particularly important in Foundry's hook callbacks)_

link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#noUncheckedIndexedAccess[noUncheckedIndexedAccess]:: Requires you to verify that array elements or dynamic object properties are defined before using them. For some values, there are any number of dynamic keys that could be defined at runtime. For example, because an array of strings could contain any number of strings at runtime, TypeScript will assume that the type of element `stringArray[632]` is always defined and type it as `string`.
+
Setting this to *true* prevents TypeScript from making this assumption, by resolving the type of `stringArray[632]` to `string | undefined` instead of `string`. This requires you to confirm the element really is defined before you attempt to use it, preventing runtime errors when accessing dynamic Foundry data like `actor.items[32]` which might not always exist.

link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#noUncheckedSideEffectImports[noUncheckedSideEffectImports]:: Ensures TypeScript validates the path of every import statement. By default, TypeScript validates import paths only when explicit values or types are being imported. This means that while imports like `import { foo } from "./foo/bar"` are checked, imports like `import "./lorem/ipsum"` are not.
+
Setting this to *true* ensures all imports must exist, improving code reliability.

link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#useUnknownInCatchVariables[useUnknownInCatchVariables]:: Makes the error parameter of `catch` blocks have type `unknown` instead of `any`, requiring you to verify what kind of error you caught before working with it.
+
Setting this to *true* prevents you from assuming the error parameter is an instance of `Error` (or any other type). In JavScript, it's possible to throw any value, e.g. `throw "foo bar";` and `throw 1;`. You will need to verify the type of the error before working with it (e.g. `if (error instanceof Error) { ... }`).

link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#noImplicitOverride[noImplicitOverride]:: Requires explicit marking of methods that override their base class.
+
Setting this to *true* makes overrides more explicit, ensuring you never accidentally override a base class without realizing it.

=== Installing `foundry-vtt-types`

Installing the `foundry-vtt-types` package is straightforward.  Simply run the following command from the root folder of your project:

[source,console]
----
npm add --include=dev fvtt-types@github:League-of-Foundry-Developers/foundry-vtt-types#main
----
You can confirm the installation by verifying that you can access, e.g., `Actor` in the global scope without any errors:

[source,typescript]
----
const actorTest = Actor;
----

[[foundry-config]]
== C. Configuring `foundry-vtt-types` to Work with Your Project

=== Schemas
A "schema" is a description of a data object, such as `actor.system`. It describes the keys and the types of values that can be assigned to those keys. In TypeScript, one would generally describe a schema with an `interface`:

[source,typescript]
----
interface ActorSchemaHero {
  attributes: {
    strength: number,
    dexterity: number,
    constitution: number,
    intelligence: number,
    wisdom: number,
    charisma: number
  }
}
----

But Foundry has implemented a way to validate data at runtime with DataModels, which requires a little more setup.

=== DataModels
It's beyond the scope of this guide to describe all of the features of this new infrastructure, but you can learn all about it at the following links:

- link:https://foundryvtt.com/article/system-data-models/[Foundry's DataModel introduction]
- link:https://foundryvtt.wiki/en/development/api/DataModel[League of Foundry Developers' DataModel guide]
- link:https://foundryvtt.com/api/classes/foundry.abstract.TypeDataModel.html[Foundry's TypeDataModel API documentation]

You'll learn how to define a `DataModel` for each of your Document types, looking something like this:

[source,javascript]
----
import TypeDataModel = foundry.abstract.TypeDataModel;
import fields = foundry.utils.fields;

class ActorDataHero extends TypeDataModel {
  static defineSchema() {
    return {
      attributes: new fields.SchemaField({
        strength: new fields.NumberField({min: 3, max: 25, initial: 8}),
        dexterity: new fields.NumberField({min: 3, max: 25, initial: 8}),
        constitution: new fields.NumberField({min: 3, max: 25, initial: 8}),
        intelligence: new fields.NumberField({min: 3, max: 25, initial: 8}),
        wisdom: new fields.NumberField({min: 3, max: 25, initial: 8}),
        charisma: new fields.NumberField({min: 3, max: 25, initial: 8})
      })
    }
  }
}
----

Follow these steps to configure TypeScript to understand your DataModels:

=== 1. Define Your Schemas Separately
In the above example, the schema describing the keys and values of `ActorDataHero` is returned directly by the `defineSchema` method. TypeScript needs to know what this looks like in advance, though, so you'll need to define your schemas in advance:

[source,javascript]
----
import TypeDataModel = foundry.abstract.TypeDataModel;
import fields = foundry.utils.fields;

const ActorSchemaHero = {
  attributes: new fields.SchemaField({
    strength: new fields.NumberField({min: 3, max: 25, initial: 8}),
    dexterity: new fields.NumberField({min: 3, max: 25, initial: 8}),
    constitution: new fields.NumberField({min: 3, max: 25, initial: 8}),
    intelligence: new fields.NumberField({min: 3, max: 25, initial: 8}),
    wisdom: new fields.NumberField({min: 3, max: 25, initial: 8}),
    charisma: new fields.NumberField({min: 3, max: 25, initial: 8})
  })
};

class ActorDataHero extends TypeDataModel {
  static defineSchema() {
    return ActorSchemaHero;
  }
}
----

### 2. Define Your DataModel Class with Type Parameters
Now let's add the TypeScript. To tell TypeScript all it needs to know about your Documents, the `TypeDataModel` class has been extended to accept parameters, much like a function, that you pass your type information through:

[source,typescript]
----
import TypeDataModel = foundry.abstract.TypeDataModel;

class ActorDataHero extends TypeDataModel<
  typeof ActorSchemaHero,     // <1>
  Actor.Implementation        // <2>
> {
  static override defineSchema() {
    return ActorSchemaHero;
  }
}

----
<1> a reference to the schema you defined in step 1
<2> a helper type that points to your project's subclass of `Actor`, which you'll configure in a bit

### 3. Describe Any `prepareBaseData` and/or `prepareDerivedData` Changes
The `prepareBaseData` and `prepareDerivedData` methods can be overridden in your Document subclasses to include modifications to the `system` data that are applied at runtime. If you do this, you need to tell TypeScript how the `system` object will look after you've modified it. This is done by passing interfaces describing any new and/or changed `system` properties after each of these methods are called.

[NOTE]
====
If you don't override these methods, you can skip this step and only pass the first two parameters to `TypeDataModel`.
====

[source,typescript]
----
import TypeDataModel = foundry.abstract.TypeDataModel;
import { type EmptyObject, type InterfaceToObject } from "fvtt-types/utils"; // <1>

interface ActorDerivedSchemaHero {
  attributeModifiers: {
    strength: number;
    dexterity: number;
    constitution: number;
    intelligence: number;
    wisdom: number;
    charisma: number;
  };
}

class ActorDataHero extends TypeDataModel<
  typeof ActorSchemaHero,
  Actor.Implementation,
  EmptyObject,                                  // <2>
  InterfaceToObject<ActorDerivedSchemaHero>     // <3>
> {
  static override defineSchema() {
    return ActorSchemaHero;
  }

  override prepareDerivedData() {
    this.attributeModifiers = {
      strength: Math.floor((this.attributes.strength - 10) / 2),
      /* ... */
    };
  }
}
----
<1> You'll need these two helper types to properly define the parameters of `TypeDataModel`.

- `EmptyObject` basically means "no changes" in this context, and lets you skip the `prepareBaseData` parameter if all you're doing is overriding `prepareDerivedData` (which is generally how you should be doing things).
- `InterfaceToObject` is a helper type that converts an interface into an object. `TypeDataModel` expects its parameters to be objects, so when you define a schema as an `interface`, you need to convert it to an object with this helper type.
<2> This parameter contains modifications to the `system` object made by `prepareBaseData`. If you made no modifications, you can pass `EmptyObject` here.
<3> This parameter contains modifications made by `prepareDerivedData`.

=== 4. Assign Your Document Classes & DataModels to the `foundry-vtt-types` Configuration
You configure `foundry-vtt-types` to understand and use your documents and data models by merging your classes with two global configuration types supplied by `foundry-vtt-types`:

[source,typescript]
----
declare global {

  interface DocumentClassConfig {    // <1>
    Actor: typeof MyActor,
    Item: typeof MyItem
  }

  interface DataModelConfig {        // <2>
    Actor: {
      hero: typeof ActorDataHero,
      villain: typeof ActorDataVillain,
      minion: typeof ActorDataMinion
    },
    Item: {
      weapon: typeof ItemDataWeapon,
      armor: typeof ItemDataArmor,
      trinket: typeof ItemDataTrinket
    }
  }
}
----
<1> `DocumentClassConfig` contains any subclasses of the base Foundry document classes that you are using in your project. You aren't limited to just `Actor` and `Item`; you can include subclasses of any other document types you are using (like `ActiveEffect` or `JournalEntry`).
<2> `DataModelConfig` describes the type-specific data models you are using for each of your document subclasses. The keys of each object should be the possible values of the `type` property for that document subclass.
