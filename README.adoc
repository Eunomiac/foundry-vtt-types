These type definitions enable full TypeScript type checking for Foundry API versions *12* and *13*.
This guide will walk you through setting up your Foundry project to use TypeScript with the `foundry-vtt-types` type definitions.
Whether you are writing a system, a module, or simply a macro this guide can be useful to you if you want to use TypeScript during development.

If you are unfamiliar with TypeScript, start here:

.*What is TypeScript? Why should I use it?*
[%collapsible]
====
TypeScript is a developer-facing language based on JavaScript. Think of it like a "wrapper" around JavaScript that adds additional syntax and features to help you write better code, including static typing, enhanced tooling, and better support for modern programming practices.

Coding in TypeScript will help you spot errors earlier; make your code more robust, easier to navigate, and less vulnerable to error; and help make sure even complex refactors don't break everything.

A full introduction to TypeScript is beyond the scope of this document.
If you are new to coding with TypeScript, the *link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/[official documentation]* includes several tutorials for programmers of all skill levels.

= Setting Up Your Foundry TypeScript Project

This process can be broadly divided into four steps:

. Configuring your project to use TypeScript.
. Configuring TypeScript to use `foundry-vtt-types`.
. Configuring `foundry-vtt-types` to work with your specific project.
. Configuring Vite to compile your project into a module or system ready for use in Foundry.

The remainder of this guide will walk you through each of these steps.

[NOTE]
====
This is a *highly opinionated* guide. It is not intended to provide you with a complete understanding of the many different ways you could set up your TypeScript project, but rather to offer a quick, clear, and convenient recipe that should be more than enough for the majority of use cases.
====

== 1. Configuring Your Project to Use TypeScript

=== Initializing Your Project with `npm`

Ensure your project is properly set up for Node.js and `npm` (i.e. it has a `package.json` file).
You can initialize a new `npm` project by running the following terminal command from the root directory of your project:

[source,console]
----
npm init
----

This command will guide you through creating a `package.json` file. You can accept the default values or customize them as needed for your project.

=== Installing TypeScript

TypeScript is a language that compiles into JavaScript. This means before Foundry VTT can execute it must be compiled into plain JavaScript.

To get started, you'll need to install the TypeScript compiler.
The easiest way to do this is via link:https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager[Node.js] and its package manager, `npm`. If you don't already have Node.js installed, download and install it from the provided link. Then, open your terminal and run the following command:

[source,console]
----
npm add --include=dev typescript
----

To confirm the installation, you can check the compiler version by running:

[source,console]
----
npx tsc --version
----

This should display the version number of TypeScript, indicating it has been installed in your project successfully.

=== Organizing Your Files and Folders

Once your npm project is set up, organize your project with the following folder structure. Just create the folders at this point; this guide includes files that will be used later for reference that you don't need to worry about them yet:

[listing]
----
my-typescript-project
├── dist                    <1>
├── static                  <2>
│   ├── assets
│   │   ├── images
│   │   └── fonts
│   ├── lang
│   │   └── en.json
│   ├── packs
│   ├── templates
│   └── system.json          // (or module.json)
├── src                     <3>
│   ├── module
│   │   └── my-typescript-project.ts
│   └── styles
│       └── my-typescript-project.scss
├── package.json
├── README.md
├── tsconfig.json
└── vite.config.ts
----
<1> After Vite compiles and builds your project, the `dist` folder will contain your final system or module in its entirety _(i.e. what you'll actually distribute to users)_.
<2> The `static` folder contains project files that don't require any compiling or processing before they are used, such as images, fonts, localization files, Handlebars templates, etc. These files will be copied to the `dist` folder as-is during the build process. _(A few examples have been included, which may or may not be relevant to your project.)_
<3> Conversely, the `src` folder contains files that need processing before they can be used, such as TypeScript files that must be compiled to JavaScript and SCSS files that must be compiled to CSS.

== 2. Configuring TypeScript to Use `foundry-vtt-types`

=== Your `tsconfig.json` File

TypeScript settings can be defined in a `tsconfig.json` file located in the root folder of your project (i.e. adjacent to your project's `package.json` file). This file allows you to customize TypeScript's behavior, specify which files to compile and which types to include, and set up various other compiler options.

Create a blank `tsconfig.json` file in your project's root directory, and copy the following into it:

[source,json]
----
{
  "$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "allowImportingTsExtensions": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": false,
    "module": "Node16",
    "noEmit": true,
    "target": "ES2023",
    "outDir": "dist",
    "types": [],
    "verbatimModuleSyntax": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "strict": true,
    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,
    "noUncheckedSideEffectImports": true,
    "useUnknownInCatchVariables": true,
    "noImplicitOverride": true
  }
}
----

If you'd like to dig a bit deeper into what each of these settings do, read on:

.*`tsconfig.json` Settings Summary*
[%collapsible]
====
[horizontal]
link:https://json.schemastore.org/tsconfig.json[$schema]:: Points to the official JSON Schema definition for TypeScript configuration files. This enables better editor support, including autocompletion and validation of your `tsconfig.json` settings.
+
Setting this to *#"https://json.schemastore.org/tsconfig.json"#* helps catch configuration errors and provides inline documentation.

link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#allowImportingTsExtensions[allowImportingTsExtensions]:: Controls whether you can use TypeScript-specific extensions (like `.ts`) in import statements. By default, TypeScript expects you to either omit the extension or use `.js` extensions (e.g., `import "./myFile"` or `import "./myFile.js"`), even when importing from `.ts` files.
+
Setting this to *#true#* enables importing with `.ts` extensions. _(This works together with Vite's build process - Vite knows how to handle these TypeScript imports and will ensure they work correctly in the final JavaScript bundle.)_

link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#esModuleInterop[esModuleInterop]:: Smooths out differences between how different module systems handle imports and exports. By default, TypeScript applies stricter rules that can cause compatibility issues.
+
Setting this to *#true#* helps prevent problems when importing libraries. _(While Foundry uses ES Modules, some older libraries you might need could use different formats. This setting helps them work together seamlessly.)_

link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#allowSyntheticDefaultImports[allowSyntheticDefaultImports]:: Controls whether you can use simplified import syntax for modules that don't explicitly define default exports, which includes many Foundry API features.
+
Setting this to *#false#* ensures your imports match Foundry's module structure exactly, preventing subtle runtime errors.

link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#module[module]:: Determines how TypeScript generates JavaScript module code from your source files. By default, TypeScript uses CommonJS style modules.
+
Setting this to *#"Node16"#* is necessary for certain internal imports in `foundry-vtt-types` to work. Future updates may change this requirement.

link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#noEmit[noEmit]:: Controls whether TypeScript should prevent ("no emit") the generation of JavaScript files during compilation.
+
Setting this to *#true#* prevents the TypeScript compiler from creating actual JavaScript files when it is run. _(This may seem counterproductive, but as you'll soon see, we'll be using Vite to create the final JavaScript for your project, rather than the TypeScript compiler directly.)_

link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#target[target]:: Specifies which JavaScript version your TypeScript code should be converted to. By default, TypeScript targets older versions of JavaScript for maximum compatibility.
+
Since Foundy itself uses very modern features, setting this to *#"ES2023"#* aligns with Foundry.

link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#outDir[outDir]:: Specifies where compiled JavaScript files should be placed relative to your source TypeScript files.
+
Setting this to *#"dist"#* ensures that your compiled JavaScript is placed in the `dist` folder, which aligns with the file structure described above.

link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#types[types]:: Lists any additional type definition packages that should be included globally in your project. By default, TypeScript automatically includes all `@types` packages it can find in `node_modules`.
+
Setting this to an *#empty array#* prevents automatic type inclusion. _(This might seem strange, but we'll be explicitly importing the Foundry types we need, which gives us better control and prevents conflicts between different type definition packages.)_

link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#verbatimModuleSyntax[verbatimModuleSyntax]:: Controls how TypeScript preserves your module import and export statements. This setting prevents TypeScript from rewriting your import/export syntax.
+
Setting this to *#true#* ensures your imports work exactly as written. _(This is particularly important when working with Foundry's module system, as unexpected transformations of import statements can cause hard-to-debug runtime errors.)_

link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#forceConsistentCasingInFileNames[forceConsistentCasingInFileNames]:: Ensures that casing in imported files must exactly match the actual filename. For example, `import "./MyFile"` won't work if the file is actually named `myfile.ts`.
+
Setting this to *#true#* prevents bugs that could occur when your project runs on case-sensitive systems. _(This is especially important if anyone contributing to your project develops on Windows where imports_ are _case insensitive, because your users might be running Foundry on Linux, where `MyFile.ts` and `myfile.ts` are treated as different files.)_

link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#resolveJsonModule[resolveJsonModule]:: Allows importing JSON files directly for automatic types.
+
Setting this to *#true#* enables proper typing for your project's JSON files. _(This is particularly useful for working with your module.json manifest file and any data templates you create, ensuring type safety when accessing their contents.)_

link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#strict[strict]:: Enables TypeScript's complete set of strict type checking options. By default, these strict checks are disabled.
+
Setting this to *#true#* enables all of the following:
+
* link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#noImplicitAny[`noImplicitAny`]: Requires you to explicitly declare your types. By default, TypeScript will infer the `any` type for any variable that doesn't have an explicit type declaration. This is risky because the `any` type bypasses all type checking, potentially leading to runtime errors. Explicit type declarations enhance code safety and maintainability.
* link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#strictNullChecks[`strictNullChecks`]: Forces you to handle cases where values might be `null` _(common when working with optional document fields)_
* link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#strictFunctionTypes[`strictFunctionTypes`]: Makes sure your function parameters match exactly _(important when implementing Foundry's interfaces)_
* link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#strictBindCallApply[`strictBindCallApply`]: Ensures correct typing when using JavaScript's function methods _(especially relevant when working with event handlers)_
* link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#strictPropertyInitialization[`strictPropertyInitialization`]: Makes sure you properly initialize class properties _(helpful when extending Foundry's document classes)_
* link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#noImplicitThis[`noImplicitThis`]: Prevents confusion about what `this` refers to _(particularly important in Foundry's hook callbacks)_

link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#noUncheckedIndexedAccess[noUncheckedIndexedAccess]:: Requires you to verify that array elements or dynamic object properties are defined before using them. For some values, there are any number of dynamic keys that could be defined at runtime. For example, because an array of strings could contain any number of strings at runtime, TypeScript will assume that the type of element `stringArray[632]` is always defined and type it as `string`.
+
Setting this to *#true#* prevents TypeScript from making this assumption, by resolving the type of `stringArray[632]` to `string | undefined` instead of `string`. This requires you to confirm the element really is defined before you attempt to use it, preventing runtime errors when accessing dynamic Foundry data like `actor.items[32]` which might not always exist.

link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#noUncheckedSideEffectImports[noUncheckedSideEffectImports]:: Ensures TypeScript validates the path of every import statement. By default, TypeScript validates import paths only when explicit values or types are being imported. This means that while imports like `import { foo } from "./foo/bar"` are checked, imports like `import "./lorem/ipsum"` are not.
+
Setting this to *#true#* ensures all imports must exist, improving code reliability.

link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#useUnknownInCatchVariables[useUnknownInCatchVariables]:: Makes the error parameter of `catch` blocks have type `unknown` instead of `any`, requiring you to verify what kind of error you caught before working with it.
+
Setting this to *#true#* prevents you from assuming the error parameter is an instance of `Error` (or any other type). In JavScript, it's possible to throw any value, e.g. `throw "foo bar";` and `throw 1;`. You will need to verify the type of the error before working with it (e.g. `if (error instanceof Error) { ... }`).

link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#noImplicitOverride[noImplicitOverride]:: Requires explicit marking of methods that override their base class.
+
Setting this to *#true#* makes overrides more explicit, ensuring you never accidentally override a base class without realizing it.

=== Installing `foundry-vtt-types`

_(TODO)_

== The v12 `DataModel` System

=== Schemas
A "schema" is a description a data object, such as `actor.system`. It describes the keys and the types of values that can be assigned to those keys. In TypeScript, one would generally describe a schema with an `interface`:
```typescript
interface ActorSchemaHero {
	attributes: {
		strength: number,
		dexterity:  number,
		constitution:  number
		intelligence:  number
		wisdom:  number
		charisma:  number
	}
}
```
But Foundry v12 has introduced a much more powerful and robust way to define the structure of such data: the `DataModel`.

=== DataModels
It's beyond the scope of this guide to describe all of the features of this new infrastructure, but there's a great introduction <here>, and you can review the API documentation <here>. You'll learn how to define a `DataModel` for each of your Document types, looking something like this:
```javascript
class ActorDataModelHero extends TypeDataModel {
  defineSchema() {
    return {
      attributes: new fields.SchemaField({
        strength: new fields.NumberField({min: 3, max: 25, initial: 8},
        dexterity: new fields.NumberField({min: 3, max: 25, initial: 8},
        constitution: new fields.NumberField({min: 3, max: 25, initial: 8},
        intelligence: new fields.NumberField({min: 3, max: 25, initial: 8},
        wisdom: new fields.NumberField({min: 3, max: 25, initial: 8},
        charisma: new fields.NumberField({min: 3, max: 25, initial: 8}
      })
    }
  }
}
```
Follow these steps to configure TypeScript to understand your DataModels:

=== 1. Define Your Schemas Separately
In the above example, the schema describing the keys and values of `ActorDataModelHero` is returned directly by the `defineSchema` method. TypeScript needs to know what this looks like in advance, though, so you'll need to define your _schemas_ in advance:
```javascript
const ActorSchemaHero = {
  attributes: new fields.SchemaField({
	strength: new fields.NumberField({min: 3, max: 25, initial: 8},
	dexterity: new fields.NumberField({min: 3, max: 25, initial: 8},
	constitution: new fields.NumberField({min: 3, max: 25, initial: 8},
	intelligence: new fields.NumberField({min: 3, max: 25, initial: 8},
	wisdom: new fields.NumberField({min: 3, max: 25, initial: 8},
	charisma: new fields.NumberField({min: 3, max: 25, initial: 8}
  }
};

class ActorDataModelHero extends TypeDataModel {
  defineSchema() {
    return ActorSchemaHero;
  }
}
```
### 2. Define Your DataModel Class with Type Parameters
Now let's add the TypeScript. To tell TypeScript all it needs to know about your Documents, the `TypeDataModel` class has been extended to accept parameters, much like a function, that you pass your type information through:
```
class ActorDataModelHero extends TypeDataModel<
  typeof ActorSchemaHero, <1>
  Actor.ConfiguredInstance <2>
> {
  override defineSchema() {
    return ActorSchemaHero;
  }
}
```
<1> a reference to the schema you defined in step 1
<2> a helper type that points to whatever Actor subclass you configured Foundry to use via (??? quick check of that step ???)

### 3. Describe Any `prepareDerivedData` Changes
The `prepareDerivedData` method is often used to augment or modify the `system` data with values that can be easily calculated, rather than storing this data server-side. If you do this, you need to tell TypeScript how the `system` object will look after you've modified it. This is done by passing a simple `interface` as the _fourth_ (not third, see below) parameter to the `TypeDataModel` class:
```
interface ActorDerivedSchemaHero {
  attributeModifiers: {
    strength: number,
    dexterity: number,
    constitution: number,
    intelligence: number,
    wisdom: number,
    charisma: number
  }
}

class ActorDataModelHero extends TypeDataModel<
  typeof ActorSchemaHero,
  Actor.ConfiguredInstance,
  EmptyObject, <1>
  ActorDerivedSchemaHero <2>
> {
  override defineSchema() { return ActorSchemaHero; }

  override prepareDerivedData() {
    this.attributeModifiers = {
	  strength: Math.floor((this.attributes.strength - 10) / 2)
      /* ... */
    }
  }
}
```
<1> This third parameter is `EmptyObject`. Don't ask, it just is.
<2> the fourth parameter is where you tell TypeScript what `system` looks like after `prepareDerivedData`.

=== 4. Assign Your DataModels to the FVTT-TYPES Configuration

_(TODO)_

== Type-Specific DataModels
The next step is to make sure TypeScript can differentiate between the types of your Documents, since each Document `type` can have its own unique schema.  The easiest way to do this is by creating a simple type assertion method for each of your types in your main Document class.

For example, say your `MyActor` class could have one of three different values for `type`: "hero", "villain" or "minion". You will have already created a different DataModel for each type:
```typescript
class MyActorDataModelHero extends TypeDataModel<typeof MyActorSchemaHero, Actor.ConfiguredInstance> {
  override defineSchema() { return MyActorSchemaHero; }
}
class MyActorDataModelVillain extends TypeDataModel<typeof MyActorSchemaVillain, Actor.ConfiguredInstance> {
  override defineSchema() { return MyActorSchemaVillain; }
}
class MyActorDataModelMinion extends TypeDataModel<typeof MyActorSchemaMinion, Actor.ConfiguredInstance> {
  override defineSchema() { return MyActorSchemaMinion; }
}
```
You distinguish them, not in the DataModel class, but in the Document class to which all of those DataModels belong:
```typescript
class MyActor extends Actor {
  isHero(): this is MyActor & {system: typeof MyActorSchemaHero} {
	return this.type === "hero";
  }
  isVillain(): this is MyActor & {system: typeof MyActorSchemaVillain} {
    return this.type === "villain";
  }
  isMinion(): this is MyActor & {system: typeof MyActorSchemaMinion} {
    return this.type === "minion";
  }
```
Then, whenever you want TypeScript to know that you're working with, say, a "villain"-type actor, you can use these type assertions to check:
```typescript
get evilMonologue(): string {
  if (this.isVillain()) { return this.system.evilMonologue; }
  throw new Error(`${this.name} is not a villain and has no evil monologue!`);
}
```
